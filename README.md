# Coffee React Prject
React assignment for interview. 

## Important!!! :
Since I don't have much experience in React, It takes times to learn React and Redux. 
So, I did not able to catch up Searchbar. Except that, It works perfectly.

## Design Notes: 
  * 1- I've class components in this project. 
  * 2- Since we do not have a backend server. I have used Json-Server for API requests. 
  * 3- I use REDUX for state management. 
  * 4- For interface I have used Bootstrap and Reactstrap 
  * 5- I have worked 2 branches. Master and dev.
  * 6- Client side works on port:3000 and Json server must work on port:3001
  * 7- I needed to add some data to coffees.json, so you should use coffees.json that is in this repo
  
 
 ## Installation 
  
 clone this repo. 
 in this repo navigate to client folder, then:
  ```
 cd client
 ```
  ```
 npm install
 ```
  ```
 npm start
 ```
 
 for JSON Server: 
 navigate to api folder, then:
 ```
 json-server -p 3001 --watch coffee.json
 ```
 !! Make sure that you have json-server on your machine
