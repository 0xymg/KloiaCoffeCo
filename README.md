# Coffee React Prject
React assignment for interview. <br>

## Important!!! :
Since I don't have much experience in React, It takes times to learn React and Redux. <br>
So, I did not able to catch up search functions. Except that, It works perfectly.

## Design Notes: 
  * 1- I have used class components in this react project. 
  * 2- Since we do not have a backend server, I have used Json-Server for API requests. 
  * 3- I have used REDUX for state management. 
  * 4- For interface I have used Bootstrap and Reactstrap 
  * 5- I have worked with 2 branches. Master and dev.
  * 6- Client side works on port:3000 and Json server must be worked on port:3001
  * 7- I needed to add some data to coffees.json, so you should use coffees.json that is in this repo
  
 
 ## Installation 
  
 clone this repo. <br>
After that, navigate to folder that you cloned. Then navigate with your terminal to client folder
```
 cd client
 ```
  ```
 npm install
 ```
  ```
 npm start
 ```
 
 for JSON Server: 
 navigate to api folder, then:
 ```
 json-server -p 3001 --watch coffee.json
 ```
 !! Make sure that you have json-server on your machine <br>
 
 If you do not have, try this: 
  ```
npm install -g json-server
```
